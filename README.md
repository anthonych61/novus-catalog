Project was created using Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate for the Novus Foundation’s newly launched microfinance club in Bolivia that is associated with Universidad para el Desarrollo y la Innovación.  It is intended to help the university keep track of participants in its newly launched microfinance club. The microfinance club is open to teach students financial and career skills in a social environment. The goal of the club is to curb poverty in Bolivia by teaching the students skills that they wouldn’t normally be exposed to since the country’s public education is limited in both scope and class time. University students can volunteer to lead the club as mentors, so they will need to be able to collect and frequently update information about participants in the club.
